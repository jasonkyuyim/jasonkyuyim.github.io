<!-- I am a machine learning researcher and engineer. I enjoy thinking about novel algorithms and solving hard problems. Lately, I have focused on diffusion models on artbirary state spaces and protein design. -->

<!-- During my PhD, I developed diffusion models for Riemannian manifolds and discrete data.
These were then applied to protein design in collaboration with Nobel laureate David Baker.
In the past, I was a research engineer at DeepMind working on computer vision and protein structure prediction (AlphaFold-multimer).

I am broadly interested in deep learning, generative models, and applications to science, language, and coding.

I am currently an AI scientist at Xaira Therapeutics.

This is my blog where I post my musings. -->
