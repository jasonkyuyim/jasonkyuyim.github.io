I graduated from MIT with a PhD in EECS advised by Tommi Jaakkola and Regina Barzilay.
My research spans machine learning methods and applications with an emphasis on generative models.
During my PhD, I developed diffusion models for Riemannian manifolds and discrete data.
These were then applied to protein design in collaboration with Nobel laureate David Baker.

In the past, I was a research engineer at DeepMind working on computer vision and protein structure prediction (AlphaFold-multimer).
I am currently an AI scientist at Xaira Therapeutics.

This is my blog where I document my musings.
