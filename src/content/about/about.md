# Education

**MIT Ph.D. Computer Science.** <span class="about-year">2021 - 2025</span>
* Advisors: [Tommi Jaakkola](https://people.csail.mit.edu/tommi/), [Regina Barzilay](https://www.regina.csail.mit.edu) 
* I focused on developing multimodal diffusion/flow models for arbitrary state spaces. Representative papers: [Riemannian manifolds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02277), [multimodal flows and flow matching on discrete state spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04997), [latent spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09374), [scaling diffusion models](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/genair/proteina/), [theory for diffusion on arbitrary markov processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20587).
* Collaborated with Nobel Laureate [David Baker](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/chemistry/2024/baker/facts/) to apply my methods for scientific breakthroughs in designing novel proteins: [RFdiffusion: a general-purpose protein design diffusion model (Nature)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06415-8), [RFdiffusion2: specialized diffusion model for enzyme design (Nature Methods)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-025-02975-x), [designing metallohydrolases with RFdiffusion2 (Nature)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-025-09746-w).
