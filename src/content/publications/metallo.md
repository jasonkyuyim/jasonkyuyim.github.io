Scientists in David Baker's lab used RFdiffusion2 to computationally design the most active metallohydrolases to date. This is the closest instance of a *de novo*, i.e. novel, enzyme approaching the same catalytic efficiency as enzymes that nature created through evolution. The biggest hurdle in enzyme design is achieving the same catalytic efficiency as nature and so the results in this work is a big step towards that goal.
