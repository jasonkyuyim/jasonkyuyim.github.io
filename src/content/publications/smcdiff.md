This work was the first proof-of-concept of using a diffusion model to generate small, toyish protein structures. The performance was poor but we demonsrated a semantically rich latent space could be learned that smoothly interpolated between different protein structure topologies (see gif). We additionally demonstrated the first application of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) to guide the diffusion trajectory towards different topologies.
