Generator Matching (GM) is a framework of constructing generative models over Markov processes on arbitrary state spaces. My prior work on Riemannian and discrete flow matching are special cases of GM. I implemented the protein experiments where we demonstrated using GM for the superposition of Markov processes that improved performance in multimodal generation. I like this general framework to encapsulate flows and diffusion on different state spaces.
