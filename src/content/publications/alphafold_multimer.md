title: 'AlphaFold-multimer'
---

AlphaFold-multimer (AFm) was the last project I worked on at DeepMind. AFm is the middle child between AlphaFold2 (AF2) and Alphafold3 (AF3). We developed a lot of the data processing, evolutionary sequence modeling, and evaluation that would end up being used in AF3. The main changes in AF3 were the inclusion of arbitrary molecules and the diffusion model that replaced the equivariant graph neural network in AFm. I was a core research engineer working on data processing, evaluation, training, and exploring improvements to the graph neural network architecture for scaling up to large proteins. Unfortunately transformers just scale a lot better!
